 This a project I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It it is a "Photography" portfolio that uses images from unsplash.com. The reason I created this project was to practice my skills, and work on web responsivess. I also created my own API, and used it to load more images once you click on the load more button in the gallery.
